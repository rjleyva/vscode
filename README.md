# Exploring VSCode

Recently, I began exploring other editors like **[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** to see what useful features I could bring into my Neovim setup. I was curious to find out how customizable VSCode is, and to my surprise, it's quite flexible.
Iâ€™ve been learning how to tweak it much like Neovim, setting up my key mappings (since I mostly navigate with the keyboard and rarely use the trackpad), customizing the interface, and making it feel like home.
My current VSCode configuration is based on a fantastic [YouTube video by Igor Babko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFOsK7IhI4). If you're a VSCode user and want to tailor it to feel more like Neovim, I highly recommend checking out his guide.

Happy VSCoding!
